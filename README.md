# Feed Reader Testing

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The previous developer never finished writing all the necessary unit tests for the application. I used Jasmine to write a number of tests against the pre-existing application. These tested the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation. This is the fourth project in the [Udacity Front-end Development Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

## How to View the Test

Opening the index.html file in a browser will launch the application and run the tests using Jasmine on the same screen.

The starter code for this project was provided by Udacity.
